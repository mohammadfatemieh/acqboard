Signal definitions for input.vhd:

CLK      : 64 MHz input clock
INSAMPLE :  Take new sample, 32 kHz CE
RESET	 : standard reset


output signals to ADCs:
CONVST	 : start conversion
ADCCS    : ADC chip select
SCLK     : serial clock out
SDIN     : serial data input, unipolar (0x0000 to 0xFFFF), ADC A and then B, per the AD7655



Output to rest of system:
DOUT     : data word out
COUT     : channel number out
WEOUT    : write enable for next stage

Offset control:
OSC      : channel number for offset
OSEN     : offsets enabled
OSWE     : write this offset value
OSD	 : offset value to write


Data is acquired via serial interface over galvanic isolators from the 5 dual ADCs. 

SRL16Es are used to store, reverse the bit direction of the samples for bit-arithmatic

We use bit-wide math to cut down on storage requirements. 

Writing offsets:

You can only write one offset every 20 ticks, and you must keep the offset value OSD constant during those ticks. 

An input FSM stores the data in the appropriate register sets. 

Keep in mind that INR needs to be cleared after every computation.
