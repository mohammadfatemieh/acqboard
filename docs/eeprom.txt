EEPROM data storage is somewhat complicated

For each cycle, we always send:
Write enable latch set
a full two bytes

Since we have 12 bits of address, we place the 11 input bits on the line and always have the LSB be zero. 

We use the two-byte read and two-byte write seqence capability of the eeprom for both reads and writes. Never cross page boundary since we always start with LSB = 0
