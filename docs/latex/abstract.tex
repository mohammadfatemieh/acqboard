Soma is a high-density recording system for real-time acquisition and
analysis of extracelluar electrophysiological signals. Here I describe
the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Soma Acquisition Board, 
an 8-channel low-latency amplifier for amplification and digitization
of these signals. Design trade-offs are discussed, and 
the resulting  analog performance is quantified.
