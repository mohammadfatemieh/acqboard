                + Linear Phase
                + Low-noise
                + High common-mode rejection
                + potential DC accuracy?

                + Resolution
          o Size?
          o Programmable Gain
          o Cost?
          o Number of channels
      
          o Electrical Isolation -- the challenges of mixed-signal design
   

    * CHAPTER 2 signal chain design -- all design data 
      -- these are all the design specs; there is no empirical data here at all
      * schematic of signal channel 
      * input: In-Amp -- component and performance
      * Amplification : PGA, filter
         * gain settings / voltage ranges
      * Continuous channels: 
      * A->D:
         * Hardware Filter design:
	   o We desire 16-bit resolution with an input bandwidth of 10 kHz. 
	   o to achieve this, we oversample, downsample, and filter
	
         * digital filtering 
	   * digital filtering simulation
	   * fixed-point math 

    * CHAPTER 3 Measured performance:
      1. CMRR  
      2. Noise
      3. THD+N 
      4. linearity 
      5. Rat Data

    * CHAPTER 4 Board operation and fiber IO 
          o four modes
            1. describe modes
          o output interface
          o input interface and bus protocol
          o actual commands
	  o front and back interfaces? 
    * CHAPTER 5 digital hardware implementation -- A tour of the FPGA
          o FPGA selection
          o Digital offsets
          o fixed-point math
          o Commands
          o Optical Interface
          o Modes
          o EEPROM functionality

    * CHAPTER 6 Circuit Design Commentary, hardware
 	* Schematics, what they mean? Component identification?
 	* PCB Layout 
 	  * composit diagram -- tour, showing modules, layers
   	  * ref appendex in the back 
        * BOM
        * Component identification
	* enclosure
  	
    * Additional Results
          o [additional simulation notes]
          o Tests on:
                + Analog performance, using Chris's hardware (?)
                + Single-channel
                + multi channel
                + Real Rat
