    * signal chain design -- all design data 
      -- these are all the design specs; there is no empirical data here at all
      * schematic of signal channel 
      * input: In-Amp -- component and performance
      * Amplification : PGA, filter
         * gain settings / voltage ranges
      * Continuous channels: 
      * A->D:
         * Hardware Filter design:
	   o We desire 16-bit resolution with an input bandwidth of 10 kHz. 
	   o to achieve this, we oversample, downsample, and filter
	
         * digital filtering 
	   * digital filtering simulation
	   * fixed-point math 

    * Measured performance:
      1. CMRR

      4. linearity 
      5. Rat Data

    * SIGNAL chain Hardware Design -- a tour of the schematics
          o Mixed signal design --
                + why not just use sigma-delta converters
                + why not AC-couple inputs?      
          o Analog and Digital
                + Oversampling and downsampling
