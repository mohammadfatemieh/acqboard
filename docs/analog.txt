More analog design decisions:

Concerns about performance of the LTC1563's THD+N numbers have prompted me to compare it to a discrete solution using our new analog analysis hardware. 

Thus, we're doing the following:

Input + (optional) HPF

Input + HPF + PGA

Input + HPF + PGA + AA

AA1 (component set 1)
AA2 (component set 2)

Because the pinouts of the AD8028 and AD8512 are not quite identical for the MSOP packages, which sux0r. Who the hell? 

Anywho, we're going to have to design for both... so screw it, we'll design for th 4-amp part for the AD8513 and the 2 smaller ones. 


I mean, just how bad is the channel separation problem? better than 90 dB for frequencies up to 10 kHz. But the crosstalk in the passband isn't much of a big deal, because we don't actually -want- to attenuate that signal. I'm too tired to model how the attenuated passband will behave, but I don't really think this will be that big of a problem for our filter design. 



New analog designs:

Wow, this is -so- not what I need to redesign at the moment, but oh well. It should be quick:
