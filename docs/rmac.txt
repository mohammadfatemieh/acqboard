Repeated multiply-accumulator, does hardware convolution. 

The pipelined multiplier is pure VHDL
WE use 22-bit coefficients in fixed-point format to increase filter accuracy. 


The 24-bit multiplier output is passed to the accumulator. 

The accumulator output is 22+7 bits wide to prevent overflow-wraparound. 

The RMAC unit expects a latency of two ticks from XA/HA to X/H (i.e. blockselect+ ram + register). 


convergent rounding, see lab notebook, which results in "round towards nearest, halves to nearest even
