          o What our real goal is
          o The importance of
                + Linearity
                + Linear Phase
                + Low-noise
                + High common-mode rejection
                + potential DC accuracy?
                + Bandwidth?
                + Resolution
          o Size?
          o Programmable Gain
          o Cost?
          o Number of channels
          o

          o Electrical Isolation -- the challenges of mixed-signal design
    * 
    * Hardware Filter design:
	  o We desire 16-bit resolution with an input bandwidth of 10 kHz. 
	  o to achieve this, we oversample, downsample, and filter
	  
    * Analog Hardware Design
          Hardware overview and filter theory	
          o Mixed signal design
                + why not just use sigma-delta converters
                + why not AC-couple inputs?      
          o Analog and Digital
                + Oversampling and downsampling
          o Signal Chain
                + Input
                + Selectable high pass filters
                + Programmable Gain Stage
                + Anti-aliasing Filter Design
                      # Spice modles
                + ADCs, voltage selection
          o 

    * Digital:
          o FPGA selection
          o Digital offsets
          o fixed-point math
          o Commands
          o Optical Interface
          o Modes
          o EEPROM functionality
    * Results
          o Digital Simulations of filtering
          o [additional simulation notes]
          o Tests on:
                + Analog performance, using Chris's hardware (?)
                + Single-channel
                + multi channel
