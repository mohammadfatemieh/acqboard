The soma acquisition board signal chain (Figure \ref{signalchain}) can be partitioned into an analog signal conditioning section and a digital signal processing section. Here, the stages will be discussed independently, except where they overlap and integrate to produce the final output.

\section{Input Differential Amplification}

The AD8221 In-amp is used to provide high common-mode rejection. See figer foo for a plot of the CMMR of the input stage. This stage has a constant gain of 100. 


\section{Optional analog high-pass filtering.}
Waveform data (EEG) is low-frequency data in the mV range; spike data is high-frequency data in the hundreds-of-uV range. When recording spikes the low-frequency EEG could potentially saturate our amplifier; thus we have an optional single-pole high-pass filter ($f_{-3dB}=300 Hz$) that can be enabled to maximize spike acqisition dynamic range.

\section{Programmable gain}
The programmable gain amplifier can be off ($g=0$) or set to a range of gains from 1 to 100; the table below shows the PGA gain, total system gain, maximum input voltage, and LSB size for the possible settings. 

\begin{table}
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}[h!]{|c|c|c|c|}

PGA gain & Total Gain & Input Voltage Range & LSB size \\

\section{Analog to Digital Conversion}
Signal chain design: 
to achieve 16-bits with an input bandwidth of 10 kHz we oversample, downsample, and digitally filter. The filtering process is the combination of the following factors:

1. an initial antialiasing filter
2. The analog-to-digital conversion step
3. Fixed-point FIR filtering
4. downsampling



\subsection{Antialiasing Filter}
The data is initially sampled at 192 kSPS; an 8-pole bessel filter achieves greater than 96 dB attenuation within the stop-band while maintaining linear phase (constant group delay) across the passband.

\end{figure}

\subsection{ADC}
A 16-bit ADC running at $f_s=192 \textrm{kHz}$ samples the incoming antialiased signal. 

\subsection{Filtering}
We filter the sampled data using an N-Tap FIR filter using fixed-point convolution. We use an extended-precision multiplier, 22-bit filter coefficients, and an extended-width accumulator to reduce the negative artifacts present in fixed-point aritmetic. 

The Parks-McClellan optimum equiripple FIR filter is used for a cutoff at 10 kHz; the resulting frequency response (and coefficient-quantized frequency response) are seen in figure \ref{FIR}. A 143-tap filter gives the required stopband attenuation while keeping FIR-induced passband ripple to under $0.5 dB$, while fitting in our allocated FPGA resources.

\caption{Frequency response of FIR filter.}
\end{figure}  

\subsection{Downsampling}
We filter and then downsample; the filtering step is actually only performed once for every $M=6$ input samples, as the other $M-1$ samples would be removed in the decimation step and thus be wasted. 

\subsection{Total response}
The resulting frequency response of the combined analog and digital filters are shown in figures blah, including zoomed-in passband and stopband performace. The frequency response following decimation is also shown, with the sum of the (imperfectly filtered) antialiased components highlighted.
