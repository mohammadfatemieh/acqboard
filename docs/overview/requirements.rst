Requirements
*******************************

High-density extracellular electrophysiology is made possible by
measuring microvolt-level signals in hostile environments meters away
from the source. The exact requirements to achieve this scientific
goal are enumerated below, focusing on signal amplification,
common-mode rejection, bandwidth, and noise.

==========================
Differential Amplification
==========================

Most electrophysiological measurements are measurements of an
electrical potential -- a voltage. Like all electrical potentials,
this signal is measured between two points, which we think of as an
active point |Vin| and a reference point |Vref|. 

Additional sources of voltage relative to ground are present on both
of these inputs, generated by uncontrolled environmental sources. This
*common-mode voltage* is common to both inputs, and can be partially
removed by the differential amplification. In practice, manufacturing
tolerances and input impedance differences prevent complete removal of
common-mode voltage.

==========================================
Input range, amplification, and resolution
==========================================

The voltages encountered in neural systems can vary over orders of
magnitude. Even when measuring the same phenomena, differences in
electrode configuration and reference placement can result in a
tenfold difference in required amplification. Thus, electrophyisology
amplifiers are equipped with programmable gain amplifiers, allowing
dynamic range to vary with the signal of interest.

For example, existing equipment in the Wilson lab allows for 12-bit
sampling of input voltages with full-scale 20 mV (gain = 1,000) to 500
uV (gain = 40,000). This allows for LSB sizes between 4.8 mV and 122
nV, although system noise performance makes the latter number
unattainable :bibcite:`neuralynx_lynx_2008`.

=========
Bandwidth
=========

Electrophysiological phenomena in the brain can be loosely divided into
high-frequency, discrete events and low-frequency, continuous signals.
Neural action potentials ("spikes") comprise the first category, with
frequencies of interest between 1 kHz and 8 kHz. Electroencephalogram
and local field potentials are believed to be the aggregate
synchronous activity of large brain regions, and make up the bulk of
the latter group. These slower-wave signals extend from 200 Hz down to
near-DC levels.

Thus any electrophysiological system will need to be able to isolate
the higher-amplitude, low-frequency LFP from the low-amplitude,
high-frequency spikes, and do so using controlled filtering that
prevents saturation of downstream signals. An aggregate
bandwidth of 10 kHz is thus necessary.

=====
Noise
=====

Even in the absence of any common or differential input, all
amplifiers still generate internal electrical noise, which is measured
relative to the input. This noise corrupts input signals and is
generally white, thwarting attempts to remove it with signal processing. 
Input noise can directly contribute to cluster size for multiunit
recordings, making unit isolation more difficult.

Current amplifiers in use have a manufacturer-measured input noise of
20 uV peak-to-peak :bibcite:`neuralynx_lynx_2008`. This can have a substantial
impact on recorded peak amplitude of a common 200 uV spike. 

========
Phase
========

Electrophysiological signals, in particular the local-field potential,
vary in frequency over three orders of magnitude. Frequently we are
interested in the precise phase relationship between different
frequency signals, which necessitates a filtering scheme that exhibits
a "linear phase" offset with frequency (i.e. constant group delay). Non-constant
group delay 

=================================
Electrical isolation
================================= 

We are looking for fantastically small electrical signals in
electrically hostile environments. While we can attempt to control the
intra-equipment electrical environment, the presence of high-speed digital
signals nearby makes this a challenge. We can not control the external
environment, which is plagued by everything from noisy desktop PCs
(ground noise, radiative noise) to nearby industrial centrifuges
(ground noise) and 802.11 Wi-Fi access points (radiative
interference). Thus we need our electrical environment to be as
controlled as possible, and ideally we should isolate our analog
front-end from all possible digital contamination.

=================================
Cost, size, number of channels
=================================

Tetrode-array electrophysiology uses bundles of four wires (the
tetrode) to more robustly pinpoint the point sources of extracellular
voltage. Arrays of tens of these tetrodes result in extremely high
channel counts -- 32 tetrodes might measure sources occupying less
than a cubic millimeter of biological tissue, and necessitate 128
independent amplifier channels.
