The Acquisition Board was designed with multiunit electrophysiology in
mind. Below is an explanation of the various design parameters as well
as the context within whcih they are evaluated.

==========================
Differential Amplification
==========================

All electrophysiological measurements are measurements of an electric
potential -- a voltage. This voltage must be measured between two
points, Va and Vref (the latter being a reference). Frequently
additional sources of voltage relative to ground are present on both
of these inputs, generated by uncontrolled environmental sources. This
\textit{common-mode voltage} is common to both inputs, and is ultimately
removed by the differential amplification.

 
In practice, manufacturing tolerances prevent complete removal of
common-mode voltage. The ability of a differential amplifier to remove
common-mode voltage is expressed as a ratio of...

==========================================
Input range, amplification, and resolution
==========================================

The potential voltages encountered in neural systems can
vary over orders of magnitude. Even when measuring the same
phenomina, differences in electrode configuration and reference
placement can result in a tenfold difference in required
amplification. Thus, electrophyisology amplifiers are equipped
with programmable gain amplifiers, allowing a selection of input
amplifications. 

The existing equipment in MWL allows for 12-bit sampling
of input voltages with full-scale 20 mV (gain = 1,000) to 500 uV
(gain = 40,000). This allows for LSB sizes between 4.8 mV and
122 nV, although system noise performance makes the latter
number unattainable.  

=========
Bandwidth
=========

Electrophysiological phenomina in the brain can be losely divided into
high-frequency, discrete events and low-frequency, continuous signals.
Neural action potentials ("spikes") comprise the first category, with
frequencies of interest between 1 kHz and 8 kHz. Electroencephalogram
and local field potentials are believed to be the aggregate
synchronous activity of large brain regions, and make up the bulk of
the latter group. These slower-wave signals extend from 200 Hz down to
near-DC levels.


Thus any electrophysiological system will need to be able to isolate
the higher-amplitude, low-frequency EEG from the low-amplitude,
high-frequency spikes, and do so using controlled filtering that
prevents saturation of analog-to-digital converter input. An aggregate
bandwidth of 10 kHz is thus necessary.

=====
Noise
=====


Even in the absence of any common or differential input, all
amplifiers still generate internal electrical noise, which is measured
relative to the input. This noise corrupts input signals and is
generally broadband, thwarting computaitonal attempts at removing it.
Input noise can directly contribute to cluster size for multiunit
recordings, making unit isolation more difficult.

Our current amplifiers have a manufacturer-measured RTI noise of 20 uV
peak-to-peak. This can have a substantial impact on recorded peak
amplitude of a common 200 uV spike. Ideally, Soma would cut this noise
amplitude down by a factor of 10.
