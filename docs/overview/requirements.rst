Requirements
*******************************

High-density extracellular electrophysiology places a challenging set
of demands on the signal acquisition infrastructure. These challenging
design requirements are outlined below. 


==========================
Differential Amplification
==========================

Nearly electrophysiological measurements ultimately measure an
electrical potential -- a voltage. Like all electrical potentials,
this signal is measured between two points, which we think of as an
active point |Vin| and a reference point |Vref|. 

 Frequently additional sources of voltage relative to ground are
present on both of these inputs, generated by uncontrolled
environmental sources. This *common-mode voltage* is common to both
inputs, and is ultimately removed by the differential amplification.

In practice, manufacturing tolerances prevent complete removal of
common-mode voltage. The ability of a differential amplifier to remove
common-mode 

==========================================
Input range, amplification, and resolution
==========================================

The potential voltages encountered in neural systems can
vary over orders of magnitude. Even when measuring the same
phenomena, differences in electrode configuration and reference
placement can result in a tenfold difference in required
amplification. Thus, electrophyisology amplifiers are equipped
with programmable gain amplifiers, allowing a selection of input
amplifications. 

The existing equipment in MWL allows for 12-bit sampling
of input voltages with full-scale 20 mV (gain = 1,000) to 500 uV
(gain = 40,000). This allows for LSB sizes between 4.8 mV and
122 nV, although system noise performance makes the latter
number unattainable.  

=========
Bandwidth
=========

Electrophysiological phenomena in the brain can be loosely divided into
high-frequency, discrete events and low-frequency, continuous signals.
Neural action potentials ("spikes") comprise the first category, with
frequencies of interest between 1 kHz and 8 kHz. Electroencephalogram
and local field potentials are believed to be the aggregate
synchronous activity of large brain regions, and make up the bulk of
the latter group. These slower-wave signals extend from 200 Hz down to
near-DC levels.

Thus any electrophysiological system will need to be able to isolate
the higher-amplitude, low-frequency EEG from the low-amplitude,
high-frequency spikes, and do so using controlled filtering that
prevents saturation of analog-to-digital converter input. An aggregate
bandwidth of 10 kHz is thus necessary.

=====
Noise
=====

Even in the absence of any common or differential input, all
amplifiers still generate internal electrical noise, which is measured
relative to the input. This noise corrupts input signals and is
generally broadband, thwarting computational attempts at removing it.
Input noise can directly contribute to cluster size for multiunit
recordings, making unit isolation more difficult.

Our current amplifiers have a manufacturer-measured RTI noise of 20 uV
peak-to-peak. This can have a substantial impact on recorded peak
amplitude of a common 200 uV spike. Ideally, Soma would cut this noise
amplitude down by a factor of 10.

=================================
Phase
=================================

Electrophysiological signals, in particular the local-field potential,
vary in frequency over three orders of magnitude. Frequently we are
interested in the precise phase relationship between different
frequency signals, which necessitates a filtering scheme that exhibits
a "linear phase" offset with frequency (i.e. constant group delay). 

=================================
Electrical isolation
================================= 

We are looking for fantastically small electrical signals in
electrically hostile environments. While we can attempt to control the
intra-Soma electrical environment, the presence of high-speed digital
signals nearby makes this a challenge. We can not control the external
environment, which is plagued by everything from noisy desktop PCs
(ground noise, radiative noise) to nearby industrial centrifuges
(ground noise) and 802.11 Wi-Fi access points (radiative
interference). Thus we need our electrical environment to be as
controlled as possible, and ideally we should isolate our analog
front-end from all possible digital contamination.
