Soma is designed to provide differential amplification with high
common-mode rejection of electrophysiological siganals. Each
Acquisition Board provides programmable amplification from 100-10,000
for 8+2 channels. The board itself has an optional early-stage
highpass filter to make maximal use of the dynamic range when
recording high-frequency low-voltage events (spikes) in the presence
of low-frequency high-voltage signals (eeg).


The total system bandwidth is DC-10kHz, with linear phase across the
entire region. The output data stream provides sixteen bits of
resolution per channel at 32 ksps. All data to and from the board is
carried via inexpesnive plastic optical fiber, allowing for complete
electrical isolation between the recording preparation and the rest of
the Soma system.

The eight input channels are grouped into two sets (A and B) of four,
with a fifth channel (AC or BC respectively) allowing independent
filtering and sampling of any of the associated A1-A4 and B1-B4. This
gives rise to the $8+2$ output channels.
