Conversion log:

The goal is to complete the conversion of the acqboard to:

72 MHz frequency core
192 kSPS sampling rate (6x oversampling)


INSAMPLE is 192kHz (or 375 ticks of base)
OUTSAMPLE is 32 kHz (or 2250 ticks of base)
OUTBYTE is 800kHz (or 90 ticks of base)
CLK8 is 8 Mhz (or 9 ticks of base)

Things I care about with the clock: 

right frequency
right simultanaeity 

192 ksps == 5.20833 us/sample
tconv is at most 2.2 us

so we have 3000 ns to work with; our serial configuration has us at 37.5 ns/bit. 72 MHz is a clock tick of 13.9 ns. That's just barely over 3 ticks per bit, so we'll need to use a small 2 bits/tick,

First, we'll need to update/change our ADC model to be a single ADC, i.e. goodbye dual-channel behavior. 

Then we'll need to redesign our ADC serial control model. Luckily this one is simpler. 

* ADC model: 

for the ADC model, we'll:
1. read in a word on the rising_edge of CNV
2. wait a while
3. clock in the relevant bits

The model only emulates the chain mode with no busy indicator.
