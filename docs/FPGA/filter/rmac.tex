\section{Repeated Multiply / Accumulate } 
FIR filtering is performed by the repeated multiply-accumulate module; the filter used is that described earlier. 

\subsection{RMAC}

The repeated multiply-accumulate unit is composed (Figure \ref{rmac}) of the following subcomponents:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Sample Counters}: under control of the RMAC FSM, the RMAC drives the sample buffer address pointer \signal{XA[7:0]} and the filter coefficient buffer address pointer \signal{HA[7:0]}. The sample buffer address pointer begins at location \signal{XBASE[7:0]} and counts backwards through the buffer. 
\item \textbf{Multiplier}: The pipelined multipler performs fixed-point multiplication of the input, truncating the output at 1.23 bits of data. 
\item \textbf{Extended-Resolution Accumulator} For each iteration through the sample buffer, the accumulator sums the resulting sample/coefficient products. The arithmetic is done with 7 extra bits of precision on the left side of the decimal, allowing for extended range and to prevent saturation mid-convolution. 
\item \textbf{Convergent Rounding} Convergent rounding of the input is performed, resulting in the output being in ``8.15'' format. 
\item \textbf{Overflow Detection} If the output is too large to be expressed in 1.15 format than the value saturates at either positve or negative extreme. 
\end{enumerate}


The RMAC is controlled by a FSM (Figure \ref{rmacfsm}) that is designed to convolve one channel's data per \signal{STARTMAC}. When \signal{STARTMAC} is asserted, the system convolves up to a maximum length $L$, and then asserts \signal{MACDONE}.

\subsection{Fixed-point noise model} 
Here we develop a model of the dynamic range. 

\subsection{RMAC control}
The RMAC control coordinates filtering across all 10 channels as well as incrementing the sample buffer.
