\section{Sample Buffer}

The sample buffer stores 256 16-bit samples for each of the 10
channels. The dual-port Spartan-3 BlockRam allows for an independent
interface to simultaneously read out the samples. The assertion of
\signal{ALLCHAN} writes all channels. \signal{CHAN[3:2]} selects which
internal block is used; \signal{CHAN[1:0]} selects whcih range in the
block is written to.
