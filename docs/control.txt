A more precise definition of the soma control interface. 

The soma acquisition board has four modes:

Mode 0 : Normal. Samples all channels, offsets enabled

Mode 1 : Identical to mode 0 except offsets are disabled; in this mode you can write to the EEPROM's offset range

Mode 2 : input disable; during this mode the eeprom's sample memory and filter memory can be written to. 

Mode 3 : Raw data mode; transmits full data from a single channel, selected during run time. Offsets disabled.
