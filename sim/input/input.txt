input_testbench.vhd

Code to test the input section, offsets, etc. Uses test_ADC.vhd to input values.


Parameters to check:

Each input test vector has two channels , A  and B, each with an independent permutation of 0x0 to 0xFFFF, all to be interpreted as unsigned shorts. 

Then, check the same for the following offset values:

0
+- 256
+- 4096
+- 2^15-1

All tests are run in blocks of 0x0000 to 0xFFFF, at 64 MHz, with the INSAMPLE occuring every 250 ticks. 

2004.04.04 : Passes all tests for:
no offset
offset enabled, many different offset cases
offset disabled. 

Found bug where we were only setting INR once per sample, not once per channel
