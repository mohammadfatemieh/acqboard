Okay, this is the assembly and testing log of our (*pray*) final
acquisition board. <br>
<br>
First, some last-minute component shopping:<br>
25LC320/SN-ND EEPROM<br>
SJ5523-0-ND Little rubber feet<br>
399-1091-ND extra bypass caps<br>
399-1096-ND extra bypass caps<br>
67-1253-ND RT &lt; dual LED, red<br>
240-1001-1-ND big analog supply ferrite<br>
240-1008-1-ND smt ferrite bead<br>
RR08P10.0KBCT-ND precision 10k resistors<br>
<br>
Now, testing plans:<br>
<br>
one board, just analog stuff -- no digital<br>
<br>
other board, just digial, no analog.<br>
<br>
<br>
Things to test:<br>
first, digital power supplies<br>
<br>

Okay, there's already some code in the "vhdl" subdirectory. Today, I'm
going to create LEDFLASH.vhd which will just flash the leds to let us
know things have booted correctly. <br>
<br>
Baah! After all this work, the vias on the lower right side of the
board didn't connect to the plane! I don't know why -- did I send them
the wrong gerbers? Is this a power plane issue? WTF?<br>

After working on the DSP board and getting it + it's accompanying FPGA
code mostly done, we can return our focus to the Acqboard, the
make-or-break component of the system. <br>
<br>
First, Analog power system, which appears to work. <br>
<br>
<br>
Just the output of the AD8221, nothing else. Just A1. <br>
<br>
So, first, just going to solder up an AD8221 and see what we get. <br>
Please note that board 1 Channel A1 is using a 1.0% 475-ohm gain
resistor that measures 476 ohms. <br>
<br>

We get what looks to be 150 uV P-P noise when shorting the inputs of
the A1 AD221 together, at g=104, would translate into &lt; 2 uV input
noise. Strangely, it also looks like we've got a roughly 1.5 uV input
Vos, which seems low. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">16 March
2004</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
Updated filter design<br>
corrected values to make second-stage 2nd-order LPF bessel with correct
<br>
values<br>
<br>
verified in SPICE<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">15 April

isolators + shift registers appear to produce correct outputs for at
least a subset of the outputs (i.e. didn't test all)<br>
<br>

Discovered that the wrong packaging was used for the EEPROM -- TSSOP
and SOIC packages have different pinouts, and was using the TSSOP
pinout withthe SOIC package. Obviously, this won't work. Solved by
removing IC, soldering CS\ and SO pins together, so all values read
should be zero. This will prevent testing EEPROM reading, writing, on
this version of the acqboard, and will require us having loaden == 0.
Which sucks. But it will still let us measure a great deal of analog
performance. <br>
<br>

Getting ready for tomorrow's testing and assembly. <br>

Well, look who didn't remember to update the overlays. This really
sucks. So, pending the arrival of the jtag hardware today, we'll test
to make sure we can boot, but that's about it. <br>
<br>
Things wrong on the acqboard:<br>
Overlay text overlays some of the traces. <br>
The connector size for the jtag programmer is wrong. <br>
<br>
But, using 5k Ohm pullups for all pullups and 200 ohm current-limiting
resistors, we have things working. We can connect to the chain, program
the PROM, directly download via the jtag chain to the FPGA. I'd say
this jtag setup was a success. <br>

A short between VSS and GND on the analog side caused this board to be
a loss, but luckily I was able to test the DL capabilities, and sure
enough, the acqboard command interface appears to work correctly.
However, the code is fragile for a number of reasons, including (but
not limited to) <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">3 June 2004</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
Can successfully download, boot, read filters, sample buffer from
EEPROM, acqboard. Turns out there were problems with which exact bytes
we were reading with the loader. Note EEPROM needs you to wait the FULL
5 MS before you try another operation following a write. <br>
<br>
Mode 2 will only use channels 0, 4, and 8 for the sample buffer due to
the way in which we write them. <br>
<br>

So, the new connector size is correct, but the connectors we bought
don't have the correct notch and so in general don't fit. But the
bigger issue was that the solder mask expansion on the connector wasn't
large enough, thus scraping ,and the hole's werent' big enough, hence
drilling. The problem was the VCC and the GND connectors, which needed
jumpers. <br>
<br>
AS of now, things are booting. <br>
<br>

Wow, mixed up OVDD and OGND pins on ADCs. I suck. <br>
<br>

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
We can get sine data in raw mode. Now, I'm not sure why everything else
isn't working, and I'm also not sure why we evidently have this damn
jitter, but I'm going to write some analysis code today to look at it. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> 2 July
2004</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
Switching the inputs on the INPUT stage for A &amp; B, such that things
will behave like I expect them to. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">10 July

Today we begin writing the batch data collection code... we'll see if
this really works!<br>
<br>

Initial tests show the second harmonic to be down by only 60 dB; I'm
not sure what's causing it, but I've devised a plan to check. We're
switching the test write-up to HTML and we're storing all data in HDF5.
<br>
<br>
The format will be as follows. We're doing all of this with <a
 href="http://pytables.sf.net">pytables</a> as a really nice interface.
Lovely, though, it appears pytables doesn't support storing of arrays
as attributes (metadata). So we use... strings!!!<br>
<br>
All files will have a "notes". We can also attach&nbsp; notes to each
channel. <br>
<br>
each file will have a channelname (A1, AC, etc) off the root, which
will be the data for that channel. In general, then, a file might have:<br>
<br>
/A1/sine/run0 <br>
/A1/sine/run1 <br>
/A2/noise/run0<br>
/A2/noise/run1<br>
/BC/IMD/run0<br>
/B1/real/run0<br>
<br>
The root will always have a "notes" field, as well as <br>
<br>
now, each "run" has the necessary metadata to fully describe both the
state of the acqboard and the function generator:<br>
Function generator:<br>
<br>
amplitude tuple of 2 floats (for IMD)<br>
frequency tuple of 2 floats (for IMD)<br>
mode (any of the noted modes, 0=sin, 1=sqr 2=white, 3=pink, 4=2tone)<br>
offset (float) <br>
<br>
Aqboard:<br>
mode (int)<br>
inchanA<br>
inchanB<br>
gains = tuple of 10 ints, as string<br>
hpfs = tuple of 10 ints, as string<br>
rawchan : raw channel<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, how to organize the code? <br>
<br>
Ideally, we do:<br>
create acqstate object<br>
create fstate object<br>
perform run, take data<br>
save as "location", acqstate, fstate<br>
<br>
really, all this code should live under "analysis"<br>
<br>
<br>
"test" handles interfacing with all the components and retrieving the
results<br>
<br>
"run" will handle putting the data in the relevant format for hdf5,
saving the results, etc. <br>
<br>
How to organize "runs"? what we really want is something that will just
DTRT given an acqstate and a function state, and a number of samples. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, a "run" could be a hdf5 wrap of a test. That wouldn't suck. <br>
