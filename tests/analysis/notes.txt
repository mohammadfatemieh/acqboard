Notes for analysis. 

readraw: 

Returns a file object that will return the next N samples in an array when you call foo.read(N). 

Similarly, there will be readchan, which you invoke with 

x = readchan(filename, channelnum)

and will do the same. 


Oh, so we discover the IEEE papers on "coherent sampling" and similar
topics. Will now read. In particular, "Frequency Domain Testing of
ADCs" in the Spring, 1996 "IEEE Design & Test of Computer" (pp 64)
looks really good.

Also, there's an IEEE standard on testing ADCs

Reading and visualizing raw spike data
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We have:
extractTetrode(raw array of data, gain)

filterTetrode()

tetrode.spikes(threshold)

returns an array of spikes

clusterplot(spikes) -- six projections
