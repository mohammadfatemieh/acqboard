This is my attempt to make linux-GPIB do the right thing. 

This is using the NI GPIB card. 

First, apt-get gpib-modules-source
then, in your kernel source dir, make-kpg modules_image
install the resulting deb


interface {
	minor = 0
	board_type = "ni_pci_accel"
	pad = 0
	sad = 0	
	master = yes
	timeout = T3s
}


device {
        minor = 0
        name = "ats2"
        pad = 1
        sad = 0

        eos = 0xa       /* EOS Byte */
        set-reos = no /* Terminate read if EOS */
        set-bin = no /* Compare EOS 8-bit */
}


ibtest can help

pad above shows that the device is on GPIB address 1
