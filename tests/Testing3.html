Another day, another series of tests. Unfortunately, the acqboard
prototype we received from eTech-WEB had numerous shorts in it,
including an impossible-to-fix one that appeared to be under the PGA
between channel B2 and B1. I have removed those channels for the time
being. <br>

The visible shorts on the ADC are above. <br>

<br>
The current state of our benchmarking code really leaves something to
be desired, and should undergo a comprehensive clean-up at some point
in the near future. In particular, I'm unclear on how exactly I run
THD+N tests, noise tests, linearity tests, etc. and produce my expected
plots. <br>
<br>
Ultimately, the problem is that the code that you want to run when
debugging is different from the code that you want to run when running
large-scale performance tests. The situation is similar with the
graphical output. <br>
<br>
We generate the following data with Experiments2.py, and then use
thdnMeasure.py to plot: <br>

Which is associated with the non-svn'd file 20060514.all.h5. <br>
