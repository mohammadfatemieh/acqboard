Another day, another series of tests. Unfortunately, the acqboard
prototype we received from eTech-WEB had numerous shorts in it,
including an impossible-to-fix one that appeared to be under the PGA
between channel B2 and B1. I have removed those channels for the time
being. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
The visible shorts on the ADC are above. <br>
<br>
<br>
The current state of our benchmarking code really leaves something to
be desired, and should undergo a comprehensive clean-up at some point
in the near future. In particular, I'm unclear on how exactly I run
THD+N tests, noise tests, linearity tests, etc. and produce my expected
plots. <br>
<br>
Ultimately, the problem is that the code that you want to run when
debugging is different from the code that you want to run when running
large-scale performance tests. The situation is similar with the
graphical output. <br>
<br>
We generate the following data with Experiments2.py, and then use
thdnMeasure.py to plot: <img alt="" src="results/20060514/A1.THD+N.png"
 style="width: 600px; height: 450px;"><br>
<br>
Which is associated with the non-svn'd file 20060514.all.h5. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Now we will attempt to verify performance across each of the acqboards.
To do this I have written a simple "channel check" benchmark which
tries to do a single full-scale THD+N measurement for all channels /
gains / filter settings. <br>

6 of the acquisition boards appear to just work, but the seventh has
some sort of ADC-related problem that has proven difficult to diagnose.
<br>
<br>

<br>
We have 13 working acquisition boards assembled by eTech-WEB, and
another 3 that need some sort of love. <br>

Print-able noise benchmarks: <br>

averaging the RMS noise across all channels, per gain. <br>

<br>
<br>
Of course, now I'm worrying our CMR might be total crap...<br>
<br>
<br>
CMR Measurements: <br>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img alt=""
 src="results/20060603/CMR.no-AC-couple.png"
 style="width: 600px; height: 450px;"></td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img alt=""

 style="width: 600px; height: 450px;"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">CMRR of board with AC-coupling
hardware removed<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">CMRR of board as-shipping, with
input AC-coupling HPF<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
As you can see from above, the addition of the 10uf/100k AC-coupling
stage in front of the in-amps has significantly degraded our
common-mode rejection, due to impedance mismatch between the filter
elements. At high frequencies, this is less of a problem, and it still
looks like we get ~90 dB CMR at 60 Hz, but it would be nice if we
didn't have to take this hit. <br>
<br>
Ultimately, the ramifications will depend on the measured CMR of the
neuralynx amps, as a guide to how much CMR we "really need". Potential
solutions would be: <br>
<ul>
  <li>remove input AC-coupling, and perform the same thing at the preamp</li>
  <li>remove input AC-coupling, change in-amp gain to 10x, and reduce
the ADC range by a factor of 10</li>
</ul>
Both of these can be done with our current hardware configuration. <br>
<br>
Again, the above graphs can be found under
no-svn/20060603-board.05.cmmr.h5<br>
