This is a very simple ADC reader, designed to try
and read the adc at 32 kSPS, and use a very slow (i.e. impossible-to-break) serial link to do as such. 

We perform no computation on the input values, and we keep an output value constant for the entire duration of OUTSAMPLE. 

WE use the existing clock generator and the fiberTX, because re-doing those would be a horrible pain.
