We have two socket classes:
   AcqSocketOut: connects to /tmp/acqboard.in, sends the command that we form
   AcqSockStat: reads /tmp/acqboard.status, detects status changes

    Call update_gain(chan, value) to update gain display
         update_hpf(chan, value) to update hpf display

class AcqBoardCmd keeps track of the current command state of the acqboard, andprovides the reference implementation for commands.

   result = cmd.setgain(chan, value) 

which will have the incremented command ID in it. Then, we wait for status to update the cmdid. 


We would also like to be able to point to a file of 16-bit ints and
