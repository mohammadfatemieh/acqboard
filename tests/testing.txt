Okay, this is the assembly and testing log of our (*pray*) final acquisition board. 

First, some last-minute component shopping:
25LC320/SN-ND		EEPROM
SJ5523-0-ND		Little rubber feet
399-1091-ND		extra bypass caps
399-1096-ND		extra bypass caps
67-1253-ND		RT < dual LED, red
240-1001-1-ND		big analog supply ferrite
240-1008-1-ND		smt ferrite bead
RR08P10.0KBCT-ND	precision 10k resistors

Now, testing plans:

one board, just analog stuff -- no digital

other board, just digial, no analog.


Things to test:
first, digital power supplies

Okay, there's already some code in the "vhdl" subdirectory. Today, I'm going to create LEDFLASH.vhd which will just flash the leds to let us know things have booted correctly. 

Baah! After all this work, the vias on the lower right side of the board didn't connect to the plane! I don't know why -- did I send them the wrong gerbers? Is this a power plane issue? WTF?

After working on the DSP board and getting it + it's accompanying FPGA code mostly done, we can return our focus to the Acqboard, the make-or-break component of the system. 

First, Analog power system, which appears to work. 


Just the output of the AD8221, nothing else. Just A1. 

So, first, just going to solder up an AD8221 and see what we get. 
Please note that board 1 Channel A1 is using a 1.0% 475-ohm gain resistor that measures 476 ohms.

We get what looks to be 150 uV P-P noise when shorting the inputs of the A1 AD221 together, at g=104, would translate into < 2 uV input noise. Strangely, it also looks like we've got a roughly 1.5 uV input Vos, which seems low.
