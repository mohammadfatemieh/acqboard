How do we want to do our benchmarks? why are we doing this again? 

I just don't understand. 

There's this notion of an "Experiment". Each experiment consists of an acqboard/function generator in a single common wiring configuration. Note that we also cannot mix raw and simultaneous data within a single file. 

Whatever, stop wasting time on this. 


For a raw file:

we store each channel in /channame/runtype/gain/hpfstatus/

with: 
   runtype == sine, square, noise, etc. 
   gain == the gain of the channel 
   hpfstatus ==   "HPFon" or "HPFoff"


Each table will contain metadata consisting of the 
   1. signal generator settings
   2. board state settings for that channel




what do we want from our RAW interface

s = SineRuns() # simply a container class

s.gains = [] # defalt = 1
s.hpfen = [] # default = off
s.freqs = [] # default = 1 kHz
s.volts = [] # default = 4.0

n = NoiseRuns()
n.chans
n.gains
n.hpfen
n.volts

e = Experiment(filename, note):
e.atsout = unbalanced

e.A1.append(s)
e.A2.append(s) : # append sine run, check if sine run is valid
e.append(n) :

e.run()
