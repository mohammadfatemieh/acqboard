This is the expeirment design and configuration for running our suite of Raw Benchmarks. 


Each HDF5 file corresponds to an "experiment". An experiment consists of a series of "runs" per channel. It is possible that, between the runs, there is a user-selectable pause to allow manual reconfiguration of some aspect of board parameters. 

States:


use: 

BoardState: object which encapsulates a single channel's baoard state set, and also handles interfacing to the board via iterators


b = BoardState

b.gains = [100, 200, ...]
b.hpfs = [True, False]



e = Experiment(name) 
e.A1.append(b)
e.allchan(b)


then inside experiment.run():


for set in self.A1:
  self.bs.setup(channel)
  for g in set.bs.gainiter():
    for hpf in set.bs.gainiter():
