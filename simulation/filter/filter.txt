This is our attempt to simulate the entire filtering subsystem. 

We combine the Input/Offset block, the sample buffer, the RMAC control, the Filter Array, the RMAC, and read the resulting Y output values. We try and use the same signal names as are used in the actual acqboard. 


We begin by writing in filter array coefficients from the file filter.dat

Then we begin the insample filtering. Whee. 

We store the output in a file, again.
