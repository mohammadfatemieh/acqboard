Testbench to test command reading/writing on the acqboard. 

Commands are divided into two categories, those that write eeprom and those that send stuff out over shift regs. 

We use test_PGA for decoding the SCLK/RCLK/SOUT stream, which we will test first.

Create test_EEPROM to test eeprom capabilities. We can write to it, read from it.  

For the test_EEPROM code, remember that the actual eerpom address =  eeprom_io address *2 because we're shifting the 11-bit input addrs to the right by one.
